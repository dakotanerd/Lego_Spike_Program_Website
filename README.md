# Firebase Studio Lego_Spike_Project_Website

During my Army Cyber Internship, I and my team were assigned a task to build a project to help teach children how to use the Lego Spike program. 
We decided to build a website that goes through the whole process of building your lego robot, programming it, and testing it.

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
