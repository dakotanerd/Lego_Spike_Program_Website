# Firebase Studio Lego_Spike_Project_Website

Durring my Army Cyber Insternship, I and my team were assigned a task to build a project to help teach children how to use the Lego Spike program.
We decided to build a website that goe through the whole process of buiulding your lego robot, programing it, and testing it. 

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
